Hello!

If you're reading this, you might be lost.
In any case, this is my blog. I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to post here. 

I do 3D art, so I guess you might see things related to that here. I use Blender and Substance Painter as my main tools.
Here's my ArtStation with some of my creations: https://www.artstation.com/lauris_taube

As for anything else, I recently got a GoPro and I'm enjoying video editing, so keep an eye out for those!

Yeah, I'm not good with words, so cheers!
